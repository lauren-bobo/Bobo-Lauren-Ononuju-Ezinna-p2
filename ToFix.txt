1) ./head and ./tail need to return an error message if no argument is given for -c
2) ./wc needs to count words better
3) env needs to be implemented
4) stdin needs to be added to all functions
5) need to parse filenames in ./head and ./tail similarly to how i did in ./wc (ie remove reliance on indexOfStart and instead cycle through optind)
6) possibly make -c on head more efficient (i think read returns num bytes so that could be a condition?)
7) more error checking and hadnling throughout
