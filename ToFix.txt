4) stdin needs to be added to all functions
5) need to parse filenames in ./head and ./tail similarly to how i did in ./wc (ie remove reliance on indexOfStart and instead cycle through optind)
6) possibly make -c on tail  more efficient (i think read returns num bytes so that could be a condition?)
7) more error checking and hadnling throughout
8) fix buffsize
9) make sure can parse no arguments on wc.c
10)
